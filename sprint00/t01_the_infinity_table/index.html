    <td>The Stone gives the user the ability to manipulate living souls: check for their presence; knock them out of the physical body, and so on. The Stone also contains a pocket dimension called the Soul World, where a person meets someone close to him after using the Stone. What is unique is that to obtain the Stone, it is necessary to perform a ritual of sacrifice, losing someone you love - "Soul for Soul".</td>

    <td>The Stone's shell, the Ether, is in a liquid state and can be transformed into a crystalline form if necessary. The Stone gives the user the ability to alter reality, create illusions, suck the life force out of other beings, break the laws of physics, and repel any threats it detects.</td>
