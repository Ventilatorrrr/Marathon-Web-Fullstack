<h2 id="what-makes-a-superhero"> What makes a superhero? </h2>
<p> A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person couldn’t. So in order to be a superhero, <b> you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human being could possess </b>, and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero. For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective story or human-interest story. But if it’s a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is doing something that a normal human being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero. </p>

<p> Iron Man</p>
<p> Iron Man is Tony Stark, billionaire and genius inventor, in a modified exoskeleton. This superhero is really special because he continues to be a normal person in an armored suit, and not some kind of mutant. This character was created by writer Stan Lee, screenwriter Larry Lieber and artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby. Iron Man first appeared in Tales of Suspense #39 (March, 1963). </p>
