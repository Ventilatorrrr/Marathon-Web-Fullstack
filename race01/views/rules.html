        <h2>Game Rules</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Start of the Game:</strong> Each player receives <strong>5 cards</strong>. Every card has its own damage value that determines its power in battle.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Gameplay:</strong> Players take turns. On their turn, a player may <strong>play one card</strong> to deal damage to the opponent.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Time Limit:</strong> Each move has a time limit. If the player <strong>does not act in time</strong>, the turn is skipped automatically.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Penalty for Skipping a Turn:</strong> Skipping a turn results in <strong>penalty damage</strong>. The more turns you skip, the worse your position.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Card Damage:</strong> Every card has a damage value. Some cards may have <strong>special effects</strong> â€” boosts, protection, or combos.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Game End:</strong> The game ends when one player <strong>runs out of cards</strong> or loses due to excessive damage. The winner is the one who plays wisely and avoids defeat.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p><em>Good luck, and choose your cards wisely!</em></p>
